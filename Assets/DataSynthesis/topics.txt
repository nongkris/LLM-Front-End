what their favorite smell is
what the best the best part of their day has been
what they do to relax
what books they've been reading
what their hometown is like
what their perfect weekend is
what show they last binge watched
what they do for work
what their favorite video game is
if they have a hidden talent
what they're doing this weekend
what you wanted to be when you grew up
what their dream vacation is
how they measure success
what was their first car
if they have any tatoos
what makes them laugh out loud
if they have a favorite dinosaur
what their favorite color is
what their favorite animal is
if they have a favorite song
what gets them pumped
what their hobbies are
if they still think pluto is a planet
if they prefer camping or a hotel
the best gift they can give
what they do when they get bored
what they like best about human nature
what the scariest part of dying is
what honor means to them
if it's healthy to be obsessed with something
if they're afraid of change
if they would like to go back in time before the internet
if they enjoy social media
